Union types enable us to accept parameters of multiple, different types. Provide either type `x` or `y`. Sometimes, these types aren't 100% compatible. They serve the same goal but have different properties. At a later stage, we might want to run some code based on the exact type. This is where type guards and type predicates come in.

## Getting Started

Let's start with declaring some types. I like to look at some code when trying to explain stuff. It makes me grasp the concept better.

Assume that we are building a blog and have two types, that form a single union.

```ts
type Article = {
  frontMatter: Record<string, unknown>;
  content: string;
}

type NotFound = { 
  notFound: true;
}

type Page = Article | NotFound;
```

The concrete types are `Article` and `NotFound`, while `Page` is the union. The goal is to write a function to render a page. I'm not going into details about the requirements of checking if a blog exists, and when to invoke that `notFound` function, but imagine that we have a single render function. Based on the contents in the database, we render either the article, or a not found page. Something like:

```ts
function handleRequest(slug: string): string {
  const article = db.articles.findOne({ slug });
  const page = article ?? { notFound: true };
  return render(page);
}
```

The challenge that we're dealing with, is when we need to know if `handleRequest` passed an `Article` or a `NotFound` type to `render`. In JavaScript, you'd use something like:

```js
function render(page: Page) {
  if (page.content) {
    return page.content;
  }

  return '404 — not found';
}
```

But in TypeScript, that's not going to work. It will throw an Error mentioning that the property `content` does not exist on type `Page`.

```shell
Property 'content' does not exist on type 'Page'.
  Property 'content' does not exist on type 'NotFound'.
```

That's because not all the types in the union include that property. To fix this, we need to add a type guard.

## Type Guard

A type guard is an expression that performs a runtime check that guarantees the type in the current scope.

The quick fix is to replace that `page.content` check with something TypeScript would understand:

```ts
function render(page: Page) {
  if ('content' in page) {
    return page.content;
  }

  return '404 — not found';
}
```

This works, but it does come at a maintainability cost. The benefit of TypeScript is that it will warn us when we remove a property that's being used. With this change, TypeScript won't warn us when we rename the `content` property to `body` for example.  Or when we made a typo in `'content'`.

This is why type predicates are interesting.

## Type Predicate

The type predicate, is the return type of a function like this:

```ts
function isArticle(page: Page): page is Article {
  return 'content' in page;
}
```

It's not the whole function that's the predicate. The predicate is `page is Article`. Also good to know, `'content' in page` is not a type guard in this context. It's a simple expression. The type guard is the `if` statement that causes TypeScript to narrow the type.

So, the function above looks quite similar to that earlier type guard and comes with the same maintainability issue. But, now that we've extracted it, we can also solve that. 

```ts
function isArticle(page: Page): page is Article {
  return typeof (page as Article).content !== 'undefined';
}
```

This works and will error when we refactor `Article` and remove the `content` property.

Functions that are declared as type predicate, must return a boolean. When the return value is `true`, TypeScript assumes that the return type is the one that's declared in the type predicate. If this function returns true, TypeScript assumes that the provided argument `page` is of type `Article`.

When we'd call this method inside our render function:

```ts
function render(page: Page) {
  if (isArticle(page)) {
    return page.content;
  }

  return '404 — not found';
}
```

TypeScript knows that `page.content` exists, because inside the if scope, `page` is of type `Article`. The `if (isArticle(page))` expression, is a type guard.

After the if statement, `page` is not of type `Article`. And because our union only has 2 types, TypeScript is also aware that it must be of type `NotFound`  at that stage.
