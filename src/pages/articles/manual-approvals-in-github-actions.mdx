In the world of continuous deployment we like to automate everything, and remove the human factor.  For me, that's not always desired. I like to batch changes in a single release when I know that I'm going to merge more changes during a reasonable timeframe. I also don't always value "approve to merge" the same as "approve to release".

Though not much used in open-source projects, manual approvals are possible when using GitHub Actions. In my experience, it's a game changer.

To do so, we'll need to use GitHub Environments. In this article I'll explain you how make a GitHub Action job wait for a human. I'll use NPM publishing as example, but it's trivial to apply the same to say publish your website to your webhost.

## The Environment

To add an environment, you'll need to go to your GitHub repository > settings > environments. Click "New environment", and give it a name. I'll name it "**NPM**".

Once created, you can adjust the settings for that environment. Make sure to enable the "Required reviewers", and to add your own name to the list of reviewers.

The "**required reviewers**" is what will show us the "approve button". The wait timer can be used to say deploy to production 1 day after the change was deployed to staging. We don't need that, just enable the required reviewers.

The "**Environment secrets**" can be used to add secrets that can only be used in jobs bound to this environment. I've added my `NPM_TOKEN` there.

Be sure to click "Save protection rules" when done.

## The Action

To make this work, all you need to do is add `environment: npm` to your job definition. Remember that I've also added secrets to that environment? I can use those secrets in jobs that run on this environment, but not on the other jobs.

```yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # environment is the magic key âœ¨
    environment: npm
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Release
        uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

And now the `release` job will only run after one of the reviewers has approved. Note that any other job still runs, unless you've build in a [dependency](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds) using `needs: [release]`.

## Only publish the most recent change

Waiting for a human introduces one challenge. What if the last commit has been published, and you'll accidentally publish an older commit? To make sure that won't happen, we can use `concurrency`.

```yaml
name: CI

on: # ...

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs: # ...
```

By adding the [concurrency](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency) option, GitHub will cancel every currently running job except for the current one. Making it impossible to approve a release when there is a more recent publishable commit. If you need more control over this, it's worth checking out [styfle/cancel-workflow-action/](https://github.com/styfle/cancel-workflow-action).

Honestly, I believe that `concurrency` is also worth adding without a manual step. Race conditions on GitHub actions are possible. Waiting for the task scheduler might cause a more recent commit to be published before the older one.

## Don't run on forks

Bit out of scope, so a bonus item. Too often I'm seeing that forks also try to publish to NPM. Obviously, it'll fail due to lack of permissions. We can easily prevent that using a simple run condition so the job won't run on a fork.

```yml

name: CI

on: #...

jobs:
  release:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.repository == 'smeijer/leaflet-geosearch'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: npm
    steps:
      # ...
```
